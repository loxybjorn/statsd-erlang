# StatsD Erlang client

This is a fork of upstream [statsd-erlang](https://github.com/klarna/statsd-erlang).
It's purpose is to contain changes to make it work with [statsite](https://github.com/statsite/statsite).

Changes:

* Renamed project from statsderl to `statsd_erlang` (API modules names are not changed)
* Removed pooling
* Allow starting worker linked to caller (under any supervision tree)
* Added batch report API for callers
* Added timeout based buffer for UDP packets batching

## Examples

Start metrics reporter under `statad_erlang`'s supervisor

```erlang
> application:load(statsd_erlang).
> application:set_env(statsd_erlang, hostname, "localhost").
> application:ensure_all_started(statsd_erlang).
> statsderl:increment(["test", $., "counter"], 1, 0.23).
> statsderl:gauge([<<"test">>, $., "gauge"], 333, 1.0).
> statsderl:timing("test.timing", 5, 0.999).
```

Start metrics reporter on demand with an optional pid registration name.

```erlang
> {ok, Pid} = statsderl:start_link([{hostname, "localhost"}, {name, thename}]).
> statsderl:increment(Pid, ["test", $., "counter"], 1, 0.9).
> statsderl:gauge(Pid, [<<"test">>, $., "gauge"], 333, 1.0).
> statsderl:timing(thename, "test.timing", 5, 0.999).
```
